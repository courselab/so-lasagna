Compare 'hw.bin' with 'eg.bin'. Do the outputs match? (They don't necessarily have too).
Yes, the only difference is the lack of a 0x20, which represents space char in ASCII, because the string used was HelloWorld!, not Hello World!

Disassemble 'hw.bin' and compare the result with 'hw.S'. Does the output (at least approximately) matches 'hw.S'?
Yes, the disassembled hw.bin lacks directives and labels but that's because the assembly file was first converted to binary.

Boot 'hw.bin' using the 'qemu' emulator. Does it work?
Yes, the output was HelloWorld!, as expected.

Boot 'hw.bin' in a real piece of hardware. Does it work?
We didn't have a pen drive nor hardware to boot x86

Test 'hw.S' implementation using the GNU build chain.
In qemu the output was HelloWorld!, as expected. The only difference between 'hw.bin' and 'hw2.bin' was the space char.
